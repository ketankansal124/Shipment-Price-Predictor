# Shipment Price Prediction

The Shipment Price Prediction project addresses the challenge of accurately estimating shipping costs, a critical need for companies in logistics and supply chain management.

## Problem Overview

### Business Need
Companies that transport goods require advance cost estimates for shipments. Calculating these costs is complex, as they depend on various factors, including the weight of the shipment, the distance it needs to travel, and the shipping method (air, sea, or road).

### Goal
This project leverages machine learning to improve the accuracy of shipping cost predictions. By training the model with data from past shipments, it learns to estimate future costs based on patterns it identifies.

### Why It Is Useful
Accurate shipping price predictions can help businesses:

1. **Save Money** by selecting the most cost-effective shipping options
2. **Plan Better** by knowing costs in advance
3. **Enhance Efficiency** in the shipping process, making it smoother overall

## Key Terms

### Logistics
Logistics involves planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient flow and storage of goods, services, and information from the point of origin (like a factory or warehouse) to the point of consumption (usually the customer).

### Supply Chain Management (SCM)
Supply Chain Management is a broader concept that covers the entire process of creating and delivering a product, from sourcing raw materials to delivering the final product to the customer.

## Dataset Context

The dataset used in this project is from a logistics or shipping company that specializes in handling and transporting high-value items such as artworks and sculptures. The company manages both domestic and international shipments, and the dataset includes details specific to these items.

The company could represent a specialized shipping service, such as:

- **Art Shipping Services:** Focused on transporting delicate, high-value items like sculptures, paintings, and antiques.
- **Luxury Logistics:** Catering to high-end clients, ensuring the secure delivery of fragile and expensive items, including luxury goods and fine art.
- **Global Sculpture Delivery:** Specializes in international sculpture shipments, offering express options, installation, and safe transport of fragile items.

## Story Behind the Dataset

The dataset tells the story of a shipping company that provides services to customers purchasing sculptures from various artists. The company collects detailed information about each shipment, including:

1. **Artist's Reputation:** This may influence how carefully the shipment is handled or how the price is calculated (e.g., a more reputable artist may require higher insurance or more secure transport options).
2. **Dimensions (Height, Width, Weight):** These factors determine the shipping cost based on the size and weight of the sculpture.
3. **Material:** The material of the sculpture (e.g., fragile materials like clay or glass) may require more careful handling, thus increasing shipping costs.
4. **Shipping Type (International, Express):** Whether the shipment is international or express affects delivery time and price.
5. **Transport Method:** The mode of transport (Airways, Roadways) is a significant factor in determining how quickly the item can be delivered and the associated cost.
6. **Remote Location:** Whether the delivery is to a remote location can further complicate logistics and increase the overall cost.
7. **Delivery and Scheduling:** The dataset tracks whether deliveries were made on time, which might help analyze company performance and customer satisfaction.
8. **Fragility and Special Handling:** The fragile nature of certain items and whether special instructions like installation are included may add to the shipping complexity.


### Base Shipping Price

The Base Shipping Price in the dataset refers to the initial or standard cost of shipping the sculpture without considering any additional factors or surcharges. This price is determined by basic parameters such as:

1. **Size and Weight:** Heavier or larger items usually have a higher base shipping price due to the extra handling and space they require.
2. **Distance:** The base price might account for a standard shipping distance (e.g., domestic shipments within a region or country).
3. **Standard Shipping Service:** This price reflects the cost of using the company's regular, non-premium shipping service, excluding any extras like express delivery or special handling.
